<!-- Working With Arrays 
Coding Challenge #1 
Julia and Kate are doing a study on dogs. So each of them asked 5 dog owners about their dog's age, and stored the data into an array (one array for each). For now, they are just interested in knowing whether a dog is an adult or a puppy. A dog is an adult if it is at least 3 years old, and it's a puppy if it's less than 3 years old. 

Test data: ¬ß Data 1: Julia's data [3, 5, 2, 12, 7], Kate's data [4, 1, 15, 8, 3] ¬ß Data 2: Julia's data [9, 16, 6, 8, 3], Kate's data [10, 5, 6, 1, 4] 
Hints: Use tools from all lectures in this section so far üòâ  -->

    //  Your tasks: Create a function 'checkDogs', which accepts 2 arrays of dog's ages ('dogsJulia' and 'dogsKate'), and does the following things: 

    const dogsJulia = [3, 5, 2, 12, 7];
    const dogsKate = [4, 1, 15, 8, 3];

    let checkDogs = function (dogsJulia, dogsKate) {

        // 1. Julia found out that the owners of the first and the last two dogs actually have cats, not dogs! So create a shallow copy of Julia's array, and remove the cat ages from that copied array (because it's a bad practice to mutate function parameters) 

        let juliaDogs = dogsJulia.splice(1, 3);

        // 2. Create an array with both Julia's (corrected) and Kate's data 

        const dogs = juliaDogs.concat(dogsKate);
        console.log(dogs);

        dogs.forEach(function (dogAge, i) {

            // 3. For each remaining dog, log to the console whether it's an adult ("Dog number 1 is an adult, and is 5 years old") or a puppy ("Dog number 2 is still a puppy üê∂ ") 

            if (dogAge >= 3) console.log(`Dog number ${i + 1} is an adult, and is ${dogAge} year old`);
            else console.log(`Dog number ${i + 1} is still a puppy üê∂ `);;
        })
    }
    // 4. Run the function for both test datasets 
    checkDogs(dogsJulia, dogsKate);

    //Coding Challenge #2 
    // Let's go back to Julia and Kate's study about dogs. This time, they want to convert dog ages to human ages and calculate the average age of the dogs in their study. 
    // Your tasks: Create a function 'calcAverageHumanAge', which accepts an arrays of dog's ages ('ages'), and does the following things in order: 

    // 4. Run the function for both test datasets 
    // Test data: ¬ß Data 1: [5, 2, 4, 1, 15, 8, 3] ¬ß Data 2: [16, 6, 10, 5, 6, 1, 4] 

    // 1. Calculate the dog age in human years using the following formula: if the dog is <= 2 years old, humanAge = 2 * dogAge. If the dog is > 2 years old, humanAge = 16 + dogAge * 4 
    const dogsAge = [16, 6, 10, 5, 6, 1, 4];
    const calcAverageHumanAge = function (ages) {
        const humanAges = ages.map(age => age <= 2 ? 2 * age : 16 + age * 4);

        // 2. Exclude all dogs that are less than 18 human years old (which is the same as keeping dogs that are at least 18 years old) 
        const adultDogs = humanAges.filter(age => age >= 18);
        console.log(humanAges);
        console.log(adultDogs);

        // 3. Calculate the average human age of all adult dogs (you should already know from other challenges how we calculate averages üòâ) 

        const avgAdultDogs = adultDogs.reduce((acc, cur) => acc + cur, 0) / (adultDogs.length);
        console.log(avgAdultDogs);
    }
    calcAverageHumanAge(dogsAge);

//    Coding Challange 3:
//    Rewrite the 'calcAverageHumanAge' function from Challenge #2, 
//    but this time as an arrow function, and using chaining! 
//    Test data: 
//    Data 1: [5, 2, 4, 1, 15, 8, 3] 
//    Data 2: [16, 6, 10, 5, 6, 1, 4]
